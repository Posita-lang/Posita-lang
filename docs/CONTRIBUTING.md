# Contributing to Posita

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Posita**!  
Posita is in its earliest design phase — we are actively developing Posita's compiler, named **Ponent**, which is currently in the front‑end phase (lexing, parsing, HIR construction, etc.), but core analysis modules like type checking, borrow checking, and contract verification are already in progress. Your input at this stage is incredibly valuable.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).  
Be kind, respectful, and constructive. We aim to build a community where everyone feels safe to ask questions and propose ideas.

## How You Can Help Right Now

### 1. Discuss the Language Design
- Read the [language syntax document](SYNTAX.md).
- Join [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/0xA672/Posita-lang/discussions) to ask questions, critique the design, or suggest improvements.
- Look for open issues labeled `design-discussion`.

### 2. Propose Changes to the Specification
- Open an issue to propose a new feature or change to the syntax / semantics.
- Follow the **RFC (Request for Comments)** template if provided (we'll add one soon).
- Be prepared to explain how your proposal aligns with Posita’s core philosophy: **explicit, compile-time, ultra-static typing with no undefined behavior**.

### 3. Improve Documentation
- Fix typos, unclear wording, or missing examples in `docs/SYNTAX.md` or other docs.
- Add design rationale documents (e.g., in `design/`).
- Write tutorials or examples (even in pseudocode) to help others understand Posita.

### 4. Share Your Domain Expertise
- Do you work in embedded systems, safety-critical software, or formal verification?  
  Share real‑world requirements that Posita should handle.

## Future Contributions (Compiler Development)

The compiler will be implemented in **Rust**, using **Cranelift** as the primary backend.  
Once implementation starts, we’ll need help with:

- Lexer / parser (hand‑written recursive descent)
- Semantic analysis (type checking, borrow checking, contract expansion)
- MIR (mid‑level IR) design and lowering
- Code generation (Cranelift / LLVM)
- Comptime interpreter and SMT integration
- Standard library design
- Testing infrastructure (unit, snapshot, fuzzing)

Keep an eye on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/0xA672/Posita-lang/issues) for tasks labeled `good-first-issue`.

## Communication Channels

- **Primary**: GitHub Discussions  
- **Real-time chat**: *(to be decided – we may set up a Zulip or Discord server)*
- **Announcements**: Watch the repository for releases and major updates.

## Getting Started (for compiler work, later)

1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable, latest version).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Build with `cargo build`.
4. Run tests with `cargo test`.

We’ll add detailed `COMPILER.md` and setup instructions once the compiler work begins.

## Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue first for non‑trivial changes. Discuss the approach.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
3. Ensure your changes follow the language style and pass all tests.
4. Update relevant documentation if necessary.
5. Submit a PR referencing the issue.  
   One of the maintainers will review it.

We are excited to build a language that puts safety, precision, and compile‑time power first — and we’d love for you to be part of it from the very beginning.
